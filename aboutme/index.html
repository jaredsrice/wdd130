    <h2>Jared Rice</h2>
    <h2>Shrek</h2>
    <p>Hi all, my name is Jared&trade;, currently a Computer Science Major. I enjoy going to the gym, playing video games, playing sports (especially soccer), and doing whatever outdoor activities that I can get my hands on. People don't actually call me Shrek, I just thought it'd be funny to put. 
        <p>  I'm currently a full time student, but am actively trying to get a job at my local lego store for those sweet sweet discounts. I like how cheap BYU-I is, not having to worry too too much about how much debt I take on is always nice. </p>
        <p> Outside of this course being required for my major, I think everybody should dabble a bit in code, or at the very least web design. Theres always somebody that needs a website, so having that certification/skillset will always have some sort of use. After this course I think I'll dabble into more advanced Web Design and maybe get more certifications, if they exist somewhere. I've been a member of the church my whole life, with my favorite scripture either being <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng">Alma 7:11-13 </a>  or <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng"> Ether 12:27</a>. I'm excited to learn with you all!</p>
