        <p>
          On the Fitness subpage, we'll go into depth on topics you've probably heard of before, 
          like Progressive Overload, Training to Failure, and explain why form is super important. 
          After that, we'll discuss frequency to help you determine how often you should be in the gym,
          then we'll finish up and put it all together so you know what to do with all this information.

        About Me  
        </h2>
        <p>
        Hi all, my name is Jared. I've been on and off lifting for the better half of 8 years now, with me 
        seeing the most results here in the last couple months. I've done much research in both the fitness
        and the nutritional aspects of welness and felt like my basic knowledge would be useful, so here we are.
        My hope is that those who visit this page will be able to have the basics of both fitness and
        nutrition answered for them through using simple terminology and explaining things just enough
        for those to understand somewhat advanced concepts in a simple level.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
          The Nutrition subpage will break down topics such as CICO (Calories In, Calories Out),
           BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), and Macronutrients. 
           It will also help answer the question “What Should I Eat?” 
           This page aims to provide you with a basic understanding of nutrition, 
           offering a solid starting point to build your foundational nutritional knowledge.

      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <section>
        <h2>Progressive Overload, Training to Failure, and the importance of Form</h2>
        <p>
        First we'll explain a common concept being thrown out around the fitness industry, 
        Progressive Overload. Progressive Overload is described as gradually increasing the weight, reps, 
        or intensity of your workouts to continue challenging your body and getting your muscles to grow. 
        Muscles grow under stress, and if that stress level goes down muscle gain decreases, so we need to 
        increase it by one of the means stated above.  
        Term two is Training to Near Failure. Basically, when you go to the gym, you want your sets to 
        be as hard as they can, with your last reps being a struggle to complete, but still achievable. 
        Basically you want to be switching things up to maintain as much stress on your muscles as you can. 
        Final focus needs to be on Form. Training to failure and switching things up in regards to intensity
        is important, but form needs to be the main focus, a subconscious need even. Proper form prevents
        injury, but also allows our muscles to get the ideal work done for the lifts we participate in. 
 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Frequency </h2>
        <p>
          The first focus on frequency needs to be about you. How many times a week can you get in the gym
          and enjoy it? Whatever that number and that time is should be what you choose to do, regardless of the 
          information you'll read after this section. 
          Scientifically however, for max gains you should aim for 6 days a week, and working each muscle group 
          2 times a week. Something like this would work: Monday: Chest/Shoulders Tuesday: Back/Arms 
          Wednesday: Legs Thursday: Chest/Shoulders Friday: Back/Arms Saturday: Legs Sunday: Rest Obviously this
          could change depending on the day you want to rest, but this is a good sample if you're trying to jump 
          right in. 
           
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>So what?</h2>
        <p>
          The big thing with lifting and any sort of working out in general is to do what works for you. If you
          need to start off with just getting to the gym, then do that. If you've been going to the gym 3 times
          a week, then up it to 4 or 5 or even 6. or just stick with what you have and increase intensity.
          Regardless, your main focus should be on being consistent. Whatever will get you to being consistent
          should be your number 1 priority.

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <section>
        <h2>CICO, BMR, and TDEE</h2>
        <p>
          Like the title says, we'll be discussing CICO, BMR, and TDEE. 
          These are basic concepts that'll help you figure out how much food you individually 
          need for your specific goals. CICO is the general way our body works. 
          Bodies need fuel, fuel is calories in food. If we eat less calories than we need, 
          we lose weight. If we eat the same as we need, we stay the same, 
          and if we eat more, we gain weight. Then we move on to BMR, which is basal metabolic rate. 
          That's the number of calories we need to do basic functions throughout the day and nothing more, 
          while TDEE is Total Daily Energy Expenditure, which is the number of calories we need to do our 
          tasks throughout the day. I'd suggest searching up a calculator to find out those numbers for 
          yourself, as those will be the basis of nutrition planning for you. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Macronutrients</h2>
        <p>
        Macronutrients are the main nutrients our bodies need in large amounts to function properly and 
        stay healthy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates provide energy, 
        proteins help build and repair tissues, and fats support cell growth and protect our organs. 
        All three of these are necessary, and there are no 'bad' macros or 'bad' foods. 
        Carbs are great for short term energy, but struggle when it comes to long term satiation, 
        which means if you fill up on carbs, you'll probably be hungrier than somebody who decides to have 
        their fair share of protein and fats.  
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What should I eat?</h2>
        <p>
          With the previous ideas now understood, you may be asking, what should your diet look like? 
          That's generally up to you. You can eat whatever you want in a day if it's under your TDEE, 
          calories are calories. However, keep in mind of the MACRO content. Protein and fats will keep you 
          fuller for longer, which can keep you from potentially overeating. Carbs still do serve a purpose,
          so don't fear them, but as with everything, a balance between all things is the best for you. 
          If you are trying to gain muscle though, aim for 1g of protein per pound of LEAN mass. For 
          example, if you sit at 25% body fat and weigh 175 pounds, you have 131 pounds of lean mass, 
          so try to consume at least 131 grams of protein per day. 
          TL; DR
          Basically, eat what's comfortable for you. If you eat less calories than you need per day, 
          you will lose weight, no matter the content of those calories. However, your meals need balance. 
          Not every meal can be all carbs or fats, aim for balance, and find foods that satiate your 
          appetite while still hitting your calorie/protein goals. Having cheat meals is okay, 
          and one day of bad eating won't undermine days or weeks of progress. Find what works and stick 
          with it.
