      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be an intro to the topics of the overall website (Basic Fitness and Nutrition), as well as who I am and my experience. My target audience is really for people who would like a quick info dump on things that I feel are the most important from a basic nutrition/fitness standpoint. 
People will come to this website due to it's ease of accessibility for new people, as well as answer the basics that most fitness influencers gloss over due to the money being found in information geared more towards those that are experienced and already are dedicated towards fitness and nutrition goals.

      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will be basic fitness ideas that’s worked for me and probably one fitness plan that I started out with to give newbies an idea of what could work for them. 
        Progressive Overload/ Training to Failure
        The first thing I’d do is explain a concept constantly thrown out around the fitness industry, Progressive Overload, being gradually increasing the weight, reps, or intensity of your workouts to continue challenging your body. Then I’d introduce another term, Training to Near Failure. It’s self-explanatory, basically when you go to the gym, you want your sets to be as hard as they can, with your last reps being a struggle to complete, but still achievable. Combining both concepts together will help you gain very noticeable gains. 
        Disclaimer, training to failure doesn’t mean lift weight with poor form or lift too much that you know you can’t or doing so without a spotter. Form is king, so when learning how to train correctly, form is king. Form keeps you safe and lets you hit the muscles you’re trying to train correctly. 
        Frequency
        The next section would be about frequency in the gym. It’ll be short but would cover the idea of do what you can. Scientifically, training each muscle group 2 times a week is most efficient in faster gains, but not everybody can go to the gym 6 days a week, so 3 lifting sessions every week to hit the muscle once a week is sufficient to start out. 
        Gym Plan
        Here I’d add a screenshot of a Push/Pull/Legs lifting plan that you could do 3x a week.

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        CICO, BMR, and TDEE
        Page 3 will be all about nutrition, starting with CICO, calories in versus calories out, BMR, and TDEE. CICO is the general way our body works. Bodies need fuel, fuel is calories in food. If we eat less calories than we need, we lose weight. If we eat the same as we need, we stay the same, and if we eat more, we gain weight. Then we move on to BMR, which is basal metabolic rate. That’s the number of calories we need to do basic functions throughout the day and nothing more, while TDEE is Total Daily Energy Expenditure, which is the number of calories we need to do our tasks throughout the day. I’d suggest searching up a calculator to find out those numbers for yourself, as those will be the basis of nutrition planning for you. 

        Macronutrients
        Macronutrients are the main nutrients our bodies need in large amounts to function properly and stay healthy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins help build and repair tissues, and fats support cell growth and protect our organs. All three of these are necessary, and there are no ‘bad’ macros or ‘bad’ foods. Carbs are great for short term energy, but struggle when it comes to long term satiation, which means if you fill up on carbs, you’ll probably be hungrier than somebody who decides to have their fair share of protein and fats. 

        What should I eat?
        With the previous ideas now understood, you may be asking, what should your diet look like? 
        That’s generally up to you. You can eat whatever you want in a day if it's under your TDEE, calories are calories. However, keep in mind of the MACRO content. Protein and fats will keep you fuller for longer, which can keep you from potentially overeating. Carbs still do serve a purpose, so don’t fear them, but as with everything, a balance between all things is the best for you. If you are trying to gain muscle though, aim for 1g of protein per pound of LEAN mass. For example, if you sit at 25% body fat and weigh 175 pounds, you have 131 pounds of lean mass, so try to consume at least 131 grams of protein per day. 

        TL; DR
        Basically, eat what’s comfortable for you. If you eat less calories than you need per day, you will lose weight, no matter the content of those calories. However, your meals need balance. Not every meal can be all carbs or fats, aim for balance, and find foods that satiate your appetite while still hitting your calorie/protein goals. Having cheat meals is okay, and one day of bad eating won't undermine days or weeks of progress. Find what works and stick with it.
