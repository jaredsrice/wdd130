            <p>
                On the Fitness subpage, we'll go into depth on topics you've probably heard of before, 
                like Progressive Overload, Training to Failure, and explain why form is super important. 
                After that, we'll discuss frequency to help you determine how often you should be in the gym,
                then we'll finish up and put it all together so you know what to do with all this information.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi all, my name is Jared. I've been on and off lifting for the better half of 8 years now, with me 
        seeing the most results here in the last couple months. I've done much research in both the fitness
        and the nutritional aspects of welness and felt like my basic knowledge would be useful, so here we are.
        My hope is that those who visit this page will be able to have the basics of both fitness and
        nutrition answered for them through using simple terminology and explaining things just enough
        for those to understand somewhat advanced concepts in a simple level.
            </p>

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>The Nutrition subpage will break down topics such as CICO (Calories In, Calories Out),
                BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), and Macronutrients. 
                It will also help answer the question “What Should I Eat?” 
                This page aims to provide you with a basic understanding of nutrition, 
                offering a solid starting point to build your foundational nutritional knowledge.</p>
