                <h2>Progressive Overload and Training to Failure</h2>
                <p>
                    Page 2 will be basic fitness ideas that have worked for me and probably one fitness plan 
                    that I started out with to give newbies an idea of what could work for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Progressive Overload/Training to Failure: 
                    The first thing I’d do is explain a concept constantly thrown out around the fitness industry, 
                    Progressive Overload, which involves gradually increasing the weight, reps, or intensity of your workouts 
                    to continue challenging your body. Then I’d introduce another term, Training to Near Failure. 
                    It’s self-explanatory; basically, when you go to the gym, you want your sets to be as hard as they can, 
                    with your last reps being a struggle to complete but still achievable. 
                    Combining both concepts will help you gain very noticeable gains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disclaimer: Training to failure doesn't mean lifting weights with poor form, 
                    lifting too much that you know you can’t handle, or doing so without a spotter. 
                    Form is king, so when learning how to train correctly, form is crucial. 
                    Form keeps you safe and lets you hit the muscles you’re trying to train correctly.

                <h2>Frequency</h2>
                <p>
                    The next section would be about frequency in the gym. 
                    It’ll be short but would cover the idea of doing what you can. 
                    Scientifically, training each muscle group 2 times a week is most efficient for faster gains, 
                    but not everybody can go to the gym 6 days a week, 
                    so 3 lifting sessions every week to hit the muscle once a week is sufficient to start out.
