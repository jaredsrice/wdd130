                <h2>Progressive Overload, Training to Failure, and the importance of Form</h2>
                <p>
                    First we'll explain a common concept being thrown out around the fitness industry, 
                    Progressive Overload. Progressive Overload is described as gradually increasing the weight, reps, 
                    or intensity of your workouts to continue challenging your body and getting your muscles to grow. 
                    Muscles grow under stress, and if that stress level goes down muscle gain decreases, so we need to 
                    increase it by one of the means stated above.  
                    Term two is Training to Near Failure. Basically, when you go to the gym, you want your sets to 
                    be as hard as they can, with your last reps being a struggle to complete, but still achievable. 
                    Basically you want to be switching things up to maintain as much stress on your muscles as you can. 
                    Final focus needs to be on Form. Training to failure and switching things up in regards to intensity
                    is important, but form needs to be the main focus, a subconscious need even. Proper form prevents
                    injury, but also allows our muscles to get the ideal work done for the lifts we participate in.

                <h2>Frequency</h2>
                <p>
                    The first focus on frequency needs to be about you. How many times a week can you get in the gym
                    and enjoy it? Whatever that number and that time is should be what you choose to do, regardless of the 
                    information you'll read after this section. 
                    Scientifically however, for max gains you should aim for 6 days a week, and working each muscle group 
                    2 times a week. Something like this would work: Monday: Chest/Shoulders Tuesday: Back/Arms 
                    Wednesday: Legs Thursday: Chest/Shoulders Friday: Back/Arms Saturday: Legs Sunday: Rest Obviously this
                    could change depending on the day you want to rest, but this is a good sample if you're trying to jump 
                    right in.

                <h2>So what?</h2>
                <p>
                    The big thing with lifting and any sort of working out in general is to do what works for you. If you
                    need to start off with just getting to the gym, then do that. If you've been going to the gym 3 times
                    a week, then up it to 4 or 5 or even 6. or just stick with what you have and increase intensity.
                    Regardless, your main focus should be on being consistent. Whatever will get you to being consistent
                    should be your number 1 priority.
