                <h3>CICO, BMR and TDEE</h3>
                    <div class="nutrition-content">
                        <p>
                            Like the title says, we'll be discussing CICO, BMR, and TDEE. 
                            These are basic concepts that'll help you figure out how much food you individually 
                            need for your specific goals. CICO is the general way our body works. 
                            Bodies need fuel, fuel is calories in food. If we eat less calories than we need, 
                            we lose weight. If we eat the same as we need, we stay the same, 
                            and if we eat more, we gain weight. Then we move on to BMR, which is basal metabolic rate. 
                            That's the number of calories we need to do basic functions throughout the day and nothing more, 
                            while TDEE is Total Daily Energy Expenditure, which is the number of calories we need to do our 
                            tasks throughout the day. I'd suggest searching up a calculator to find out those numbers for 
                            yourself, as those will be the basis of nutrition planning for you.

                <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
                    <div class="nutrition-content">
                        <p>
                            Macronutrients are the main nutrients our bodies need in large amounts to function properly and 
                            stay healthy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates provide energy, 
                            proteins help build and repair tissues, and fats support cell growth and protect our organs. 
                            All three of these are necessary, and there are no 'bad' macros or 'bad' foods. 
                            Carbs are great for short term energy, but struggle when it comes to long term satiation, 
                            which means if you fill up on carbs, you'll probably be hungrier than somebody who decides to have 
                            their fair share of protein and fats.

                <h3>What Should I Eat? and Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <div class="nutrition-content">
                        <p>
                            With the previous ideas now understood, you may be asking, what should your diet look like? 
                            That's generally up to you. You can eat whatever you want in a day if it's under your TDEE, 
                            calories are calories. However, keep in mind of the MACRO content. Protein and fats will keep you 
                            fuller for longer, which can keep you from potentially overeating. Carbs still do serve a purpose,
                            so don't fear them, but as with everything, a balance between all things is the best for you. 
                            If you are trying to gain muscle though, aim for 1g of protein per pound of LEAN mass. For 
                            example, if you sit at 25% body fat and weigh 175 pounds, you have 131 pounds of lean mass, 
                            so try to consume at least 131 grams of protein per day. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basically, eat what's comfortable for you. If you eat less calories than you need per day, 
                            you will lose weight, no matter the content of those calories. However, your meals need balance. 
                            Not every meal can be all carbs or fats, aim for balance, and find foods that satiate your 
                            appetite while still hitting your calorie/protein goals. Having cheat meals is okay, 
                            and one day of bad eating won't undermine days or weeks of progress. Find what works and stick 
                            with it.
